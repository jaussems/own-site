        In 2019, I embarked on a transformative journey. I decided to reinvent
        myself and pursue my passion for technology. I enrolled in a full-stack
        development bootcamp called Codaisseur, where I immersed myself in the
        world of coding and software development. Since then, I've been on a
        continuous learning journey, always striving to improve my skills and
        expand my knowledge. I firmly believe in the importance of having a
        growth mindset, especially in the fast-paced world of technology. For
        me, the most enjoyable aspect of being a developer is the opportunity to
        learn new things every day. As a result of my dedication and hard work,
        I've had the privilege of working with various companies, gaining
        valuable experience in designing apps and creating innovative solutions.
        Over the past two and a half years, I've had the opportunity to work on
        frontend websites and build mobile apps, honing my skills and
        contributing to the success of each project. I'm excited about the
        future and the endless possibilities that lie ahead. I'm committed to
        continuing my journey as a developer, always seeking new challenges and
        opportunities for growth.
